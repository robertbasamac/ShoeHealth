# Shoe Health App Policy

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Shoe Health**! Our app is designed to help you monitor the lifespan of your running shoes and optimize your workout performance. We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing transparency about how we handle your information.

## 2. Data Collection

Shoe Health requests access to specific data from **Apple Health** to enhance the accuracy of shoe lifespan tracking and workout insights:

- **Running Workouts**: Including details such as distance and duration.
- **Distance Walking + Running**: To calculate accurate shoe usage and wear levels.
- **Heart Rate**: Used for analyzing workout intensity, which may impact shoe wear patterns.
- **Step Count**: Assists in understanding total usage for each shoe.
- **Running Power**: Provides insights into performance metrics that influence shoe wear.

## 3. Data Usage

The data imported from Apple Health is used solely to track and calculate the wear level of your running shoes. We use this data to:

- Track the wear of each pair of shoes based on workouts and other performance metrics.
- Provide personalized notifications and insights to help you decide when it’s time to replace your shoes.

**None of the data from Apple Health is stored or retained by Shoe Health beyond these temporary calculations.**

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Shoe Profiles**: Your custom shoe profiles are securely stored on your device and in **iCloud**, enabling access across your Apple devices.
- **Apple Health Data**: All data imported from Apple Health (workouts, distance, heart rate, step count, and running power) is used only for temporary in-app calculations and is not stored anywhere on our servers or in the app.
- **No Third-Party Access**: Only you have access to this data, with no external sharing.

## 5. Third-Party Integrations

Shoe Health integrates solely with **Apple Health** for data collection, and this connection can be enabled or disabled at any time in your device settings.

## 6. User Rights

As a user of Shoe Health, you maintain full control over your data:

- **Access and Modify**: You can view and manage shoe profiles and workout assignments anytime.
- **Delete Data**: You may delete any shoe profile from the app, and deleting the app entirely removes all related data from your device.
- **Control Permissions**: Enable or disable Apple Health data permissions through your device’s privacy settings.

## 7. Data Retention

All data remains on your device and in **iCloud** as long as the app is installed. If you delete the app, data will be removed from your device but will remain in iCloud. This allows you to restore your shoe profiles and related data upon reinstalling the app or when using a new device with the same iCloud account.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in app features or privacy practices. You’ll be notified of any significant updates, and we encourage regular review of this page.
